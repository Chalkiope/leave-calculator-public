## About this project

In the country I live and work in, annual leave is accrued as you work, as opposed to your whole leave entitlement being awarded at the start of a new work year. This system made it a bit difficult for me to figure out how much leave I had at any given point. I was looking for a way to calculate this and also a way to figure out how much leave I would have available at any point in the future, with certain future leave plans already considered.
What started out as a small codepen and a mere quick and dirty solution to an actual need, turned into this leave management tool, using DatoCMS as a backend.
